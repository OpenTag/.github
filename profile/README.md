OpenTag is an open-source platform that enables individuals to create and manage their own medical tags. By generating a QR code linked to your medical information, OpenTag ensures that first responders have immediate access to critical data in emergencies. Our platform is free, secure, and customizable, empowering you to take control of your health information.

## Key Features

- **Open Source**: Built with open-source technologies, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Free Forever**: No hidden costs or star marks, ever. Free and accessible for everyone, forever.
- **Secure**: Your data is protected with industry-leading security measures.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Your Mode**: Decide between creating an online profile or generating a serverless QR code that contains your medical information directly within the code.
2. **Create Your Profile**: If opting for an online profile, enter your essential medical information into our secure platform.
3. **Generate QR Code**: OpenTag creates a unique QR code linked to your online profile or encodes your information directly into the QR code for the serverless option.
4. **Apply the Tag**: Print and attach the QR code to personal items like helmets, backpacks, or vehicles.
5. **Emergency Access**: In case of an emergency, first responders can scan the QR code to access your vital information instantly.

## Flexible Options

OpenTag offers flexibility to suit your preferences:

- **Online Profile**: Maintain an online profile that can be updated anytime, with the QR code linking to the most current information.
- **Serverless QR Code**: For those who prefer not to have an online profile, OpenTag can generate a QR code that directly contains your medical information, ensuring complete data sovereignty.
